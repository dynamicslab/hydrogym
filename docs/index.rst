Hydrogym Reference Documentation
===================================

**Hydrogym** is an open-source library of challenge problems in data-driven modeling and
control of fluid dynamics for state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms. For that purposes it exposes a number of APIs at multiple levels
to allow every user to interact with the environment in the way most befitting of their
algorithmic approach. While the current
